For the backend, typically built with Node.js, running npm install installs all the necessary dependencies specified in the package.json file, and npm start starts the server.

For the frontend, built with Flutter, you'd run flutter pub get to fetch the dependencies listed in the pubspec.yaml file, and then flutter run to start the application.

Here's a breakdown of the steps for each:

Backend (Node.js):

Navigate to the backend folder.
Run npm install to install dependencies.
Run npm start to start the server.

Frontend (Flutter):

Navigate to the frontend folder.
Run flutter pub get to fetch dependencies.
Run flutter run to start the application.
